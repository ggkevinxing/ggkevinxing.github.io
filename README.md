Personal website using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), most of the stylesheet is [Bootswatch's Yeti theme](http://bootswatch.com/yeti/), other CSS written by me is mostly for fixing padding/spacing issues.

For now this site serves to showcase projects I've been working on, but progress on writing in-detail about each project has been slow.
