            University of Waterloo.

          <p>
            The player drops tetrominos onto a game board while enemies stumble
            from one end of the screen to the next. While the player is
            concerned about clearing lines, they also must strategically hinder
            the march of the monsters. Every few pieces, a tower block is
            dropped which will fire and deal damage to defeat them.

            An RPG with less omniscience made in Unity for the Winter 2015 Games
            Institute Game Jam at the University of Waterloo.

          <p>
            Unlike typical RPGs, information about attributes such as health are
            only gauged by observations made by the character in the form of
            dialogue.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was mainly practice to expand knowledge of Unity and C#,
            implementing features that I didn't have time to try with
            <a href="projects/2014/asympleplatformer/">aSymplePlatformer</a>
            like instantiation, persistent information carried across multiple
            scenes, and sound.

            Obviously, this is an always on-going project. In the future, I'd
            like to move away from GitHub Pages and take advantage of
            server-side code, something that I cannot do under current
            circumstances. Hence, the site is entirely static for the time
            being.

            The first player controls a character trying to complete platforming
            levels while the second player uses the mouse to drag and drop
            obstacles into the level in attempts to stop the first player from
            successfully reaching the end of the level.

            My contributions during my time working on the site over the summer
            mainly comprised of improving backwards compatibility with older
            browsers as old as Internet Explorer 6 (as a charity they value as
            broad an audience as possible) and implementing basic features such
            as a fixed-position donation bar and minor adjustments of interface
            elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was not working on the website from its inception, so it was an
            interesting experience learning how to adapt to foundations that
            others have written and building upon it.
