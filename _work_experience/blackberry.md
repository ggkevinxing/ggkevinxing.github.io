My first ever work experience! This was an internship at BlackBerry's Toronto office which was primarily focused on research and development for products targeted at an enterprise audience. 

I created a Slack bot integration that allowed users to share secure links to files hosted on WatchDox, BlackBerry's cloud-based secure file-sharing service.
