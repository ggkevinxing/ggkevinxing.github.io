At Autodesk I got to work on a team that was developing a proprietary JavaScript library that would be used as a common source of helpful functions and features for engineers throughout the entire company. I helped develop small features for this library, created samples that demonstrated the use of it, and eventually also implemented features for a 3D printing cloud application with it. It was a fun experience as an intern, especially the part where I got to use the 3D printers!
