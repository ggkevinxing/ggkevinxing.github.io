At Autodesk I got to work on a team that was developing a proprietary JavaScript library that would be used as a common source of helpful functions and features for engineers throughout the entire company. I helped develop small features for this library, created demos for it, and implemented new features in a 3D printing web app with it. 

It was fun playing with 3D printers!
