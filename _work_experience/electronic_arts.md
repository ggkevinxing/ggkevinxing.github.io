My name is in the credits of a [game](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfB6jHyHb8b/) purchased by millions! What a fun fact I can now say about myself because of my time at EA. 

On UFC 3 I got to work on all things UI: 

* Worked with Technical Artists to recreate designed UI elements and animations in-game

* Implemented game mode and menu logic

* Extended controller functionality on the UI layer which allows the UI to have finer control over things such as the rumble motors in the controller. 

The last point was key for more creative experiences such as adding light feedback to indicate when you've reached the end of a menu for accessibility purposes.
