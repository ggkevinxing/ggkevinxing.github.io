My name is in the credits of a [game](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfB6jHyHb8b/) purchased by millions! What a fun fact I can now say about myself because of my time at EA. As a member of the User Interface team for UFC 3, I got to implement all things UI: I worked with Technical Artists to put elements, animations and art assets into the game, I implemented game mode and menu logic, and most importantly I extended controller functionality on the UI layer. In practice the added functionality allows the UI to have finer control over things such as the rumble motors in the controller, allowing for more creative experiences such as adding light feedback when you've reached the end of a menu for accessibility purposes or adding an increasingly intense rumbling sensation as you open a pack of Ultimate Fighter cards for a more dopamine-inducing unboxing experience.
