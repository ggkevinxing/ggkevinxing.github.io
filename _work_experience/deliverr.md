When I first joined I was about (we didn't really keep count) the 12th engineer and we were in total only about 30 people. By the time we were [acquired by Shopify](https://deliverr.com/blog/deliverr-shopify-finalize-acquisition/) in 2022, we were over 500 strong!

From 2019-2021 built backend systems as the sole member of the Growth Engineering team, building out internal tools that powered our sales and marketing teams as well as external-facing features such as cost calculators for encouraging new user acquisition or merchant performance dashboards for encouraging continued user engagement and retention. 

From 2021 onward I joined our Delivery Programs team and took ownership of Marketplace Fast Tags, implementing optimizations and new features for providing fast shipping estimates and badges on listings for marketplaces such as eBay, Walmart, Wish, etc. with the best degree of accuracy.
