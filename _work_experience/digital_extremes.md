My first real-world exposure to data engineering, data analysis, and data science. I implemented data collection pipelines throughout various parts of their flagship game [Warframe](https://www.warframe.com/), analyzed player behavior data, and wrote a short paper on recommender systems and approaches the team could implement for improving engagement for their in-game store.
