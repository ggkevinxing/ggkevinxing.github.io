<p>My team's entry in the Fall GI Jam 2014 hosted by the Games Institute of the University of Waterloo. The team was comprised of myself, <a href="https://github.com/sergei1152" class="user-mention">@sergei1152</a> and <a href="https://github.com/shanpls" class="user-mention">@shanpls</a>). One of the main optional themes for this jam was asymmetry, and so we put together a simple platformer with a neat twist of asymmetric competitive multiplayer. The game is controlled by one player on the keyboard and the other on a mouse; the keyboard controls a character on-screen that must get from one end of the level to the other, while the mouse has access to an array of traps and obstacles to drop into the level in real-time as the first player is navigating the level. </p>

<p>(as I have more time I will update this page on various challenges we faced and neat ideas or solutions we came up with during development)</p>

<p>You can view the state of the game at the end of the Game Jam <a href="https://github.com/FroshBite/aSymplePlatformer/tree/master/asympleplatformer">here</a>, but I am continuing to work on improving little things for the Games Institute's office open house in the coming weeks. That branch of the game can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/FroshBite/aSymplePlatformer/tree/test_build_possibly_for_GI_open/asympleplatformer">here.</a></p>
