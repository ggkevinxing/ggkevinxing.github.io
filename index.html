	      <p><strong>January 2015 - Present</strong></p>
	      <p>An RPG with less omniscience made in Unity for the Winter 2015 Games Institute Game Jam at the University of Waterloo.</p>
        <p>Unlike typical RPGs, information about attributes such as health are only gauged by observations made by the character in the form of dialogue.</p>
        <p>This was mainly practice to expand knowledge of Unity and C#, implementing features that I didn't have time to try with <a href="projects/2014/asympleplatformer/">aSymplePlatformer</a> like instantiation, persistent information carried across multiple scenes, and sound. </p>
        <p>Development is a collaboartive effort between myself and two friends (<a href="https://github.com/shanpls">@shanpls</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yaronkoller">@yaronkoller</a>) and is currently still on-going.</p>

              <p>Development was a collaboartive effort between myself and two friends (<a href="https://github.com/sergei1152">@sergei1152</a> and <a href="https://github.com/shanpls">@shanpls</a>). As of January 2015, development had halted as the team moved on to their next game project for the GI Jam of Winter 2015.</p>

              <p>My contributions during my time working on the site over the summer mainly comprised of improving backwards compatibility with older browsers as old as Internet Explorer 6 (as a charity they value as broad an audience as possible) and implementing basic features such as a fixed-position donation bar and minor adjustments of interface elements.</p>
              <p>I was not working on the website from its inception, so it was an interesting experience learning how to adapt to foundations that others have written and building upon it. </p>
